## Project Prompt 
Promt: The project aims to synthesize different parts of knowledge acquired in this course. It is a group project with a team size of 2 to 4. Each group needs to raise a question (or form a hypothesis) about the raining data but should download additional data than the existing Tucson and Weather data in 2018-2020. You will analyze the downloaded data and conclude from the new data. Each group submits one copy of the report, including your research question, workflow, results, and conclusion. It ends with the contribution of each team member. Please attach separate files for the program coded for the project with respective suffix names (.r, .sh, or .py).

Language: Python

## Project Hypothesis
Hypothesis: An increase in the number of wildfires in Arizona is a result of higher temperatures, a longer heat season (summer), and less precipitation.

Data: Fire, climate, and multispectral data for the year 2020 in the entire state of Arizona.

Climate data TBD

Remote sensing data TBD

Workflow:

Chosen and Nasser: Data summarizing (rain and temp montly AVG, change over time, total number of fires in the year, total fires per month, acres burned per month, cause of fire (ex: lightning from more rain), and potantial addition of statistical significance of location of fire, climate data, cause of fire. Data visualizations: scatter plot over map, line plots

Madeline and Truman: Analyzing remote sensing data to identify effects of wildfires and climate on vegetation indices. Visualizing remote sensing images to visually identify fire locations.
